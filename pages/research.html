        <h2>BEFTA Project</h2>
        <p>
          The BEFTA project aims to quantify the effect of habitat complexity within oil palm plantations on biodiversity and the role of this biodiversity in ecosystem functioning and productivity.
          Working closely with industry partners, Sinar Mas Agro Resources and Technology Corporation Research Institute (SMARTRI), the project experimentally manipulates the oil palm landscape to link biodiversity changes with ecosystem functions and crop production.

            <strong>Project objectives:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Quantify the effect of habitat complexity on biodiversity, ecosystem function, and services within oil palm plantations.</li>
              <li>Develop experimental approaches to distinguish effects of habitat structure vs. biodiversity on ecosystem functioning.</li>
              <li>Model optimal understory and epiphyte cover to maximize biodiversity and economic returns.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Experimental setup:</strong></li>
          <li>
            Fieldwork is conducted in Riau, Sumatra, within SMARTRI-managed plantations. We established 18 plots (2.25 ha each), using three levels of habitat complexity, replicated six times across the landscape.

            <strong>Treatments:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduced complexity – all understory and epiphytes removed using herbicides.</li>
              <li>Normal complexity – standard industry management.</li>
              <li>Enhanced complexity – reduced herbicide use, minimal understory cutting.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <strong>Data Collection:</strong>
            <p>
              The BEFTA team is collecting data on a wide variety of environmental factors, taxonomic groups, ecosystem functions, and crop productivity and management. By collecting intensive data on multiple factors in the same areas both before and after the experimental treatment, analyses take existing habitat variability into account.

        <h2>RERTA Project</h2>
        <p>
          The Riparian Ecosystem Restoration in Tropical Agriculture (RERTA) Project, established in 2018, experimentally tests active vs. passive restoration in riparian margins during oil palm replanting. Sampling is conducted at three distances from the river:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Within the riparian margin (adjacent to the river)</li>
          <li>Adjacent to the margin (50m from the river)</li>
          <li>Deep within the oil palm landscape (&gt;500m from the river)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Monitoring plots were also established within each distance and within aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Treatment types include:</strong></li>
          <li>A: Enrichment planting with mature oil palm in 50m buffer.</li>
          <li>B: No restoration; maintain 50m mature oil palm buffer.</li>
          <li>C: Enrichment planting; remove mature oil palm to river margin.</li>
          <li>D: No restoration; replant young oil palm to river margin.</li>

        Research project: Managing tropical agricultural ecosystems for resistance and recovery of ecosystem processes
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This NERC funded project will investigate how extreme weather patterns (such as the 2015/16 El Niño drought event) impact oil palm ecosystems and production. Using the BEFTA large-scale experiments the investigate the potential that different understory management treatments have to provide resistance and recovery of ecosystem processes in oil palm plantations in the face of the drought.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Although oil palm houses far fewer species than the tropical rainforest it replaces, it is still complex compared to most agricultural systems, with a diverse understory of herbaceous plants and numerous epiphytes growing on the oil palm trunks. It is also a long-lived crop, with replanting taking place approximately every 25 years. There is, therefore, considerable scope for management practices to increase biodiversity levels within oil palm plantations, with potential benefits for important ecosystem processes and crop yield. Such an increase in biodiversity may have a particular benefit in El Niño years, as this may make ecosystem processes more resistant to climatic variation and enable faster recovery following the drought. Findings from this work will be of direct relevance to both agricultural practitioners and to the conservation community and will lead to specific management recommendations for improving the sustainable production of this globally-important crops.
